This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# RealEstateRadar Project Technologies

Welcome to the RealEstateRadar project! This document outlines all the necessary technologies and tools you will need to set up your development environment for this project.

## Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It's essential for our project because we'll be using Next.js, which relies on Node.js.

- Download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Node.js comes with `npm`, the package manager we'll use to handle our project dependencies.

## Text Editor

A reliable text editor is crucial for coding efficiently. We recommend:

- Download Visual Studio Code (VS Code) [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- VS Code is free, feature-rich, and extensively supports web development.

## Git

Git is a version control system that lets us manage our project codebase effectively.

- Download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/).
- Git integrates with VS Code, and we'll use it for version control and deploying our projects to GitHub and Vercel.

## React Dev Tools

React Dev Tools is a browser extension that allows you to inspect and debug your React components.

- Download for Chrome from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).
- Download for Firefox from the [Firefox Add-ons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/).

## MongoDB Compass

MongoDB Compass is the GUI for MongoDB, useful for managing your databases.

- Download MongoDB Compass [here](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass).

## VS Code Extensions

Enhance your development experience with these recommended VS Code extensions:

#### Prettier

- Prettier automatically formats your code, ensuring consistency.
- Install it from the Extensions view in VS Code.
- Enable "format on save" in settings for automatic formatting.

#### ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets

- Provides snippets for quickly creating React components and more.
- Type `rafce` to generate a new component structure instantly.

#### JavaScript (ES6) code snippets

- Handy for writing JavaScript code more efficiently with snippets for common patterns.

#### Multiple Cursor Case Preserver

- Maintains the case of text when using multiple cursors, a subtle yet handy feature.

## Additional Tools (Optional)

While not required for this course, the following tools are highly recommended to enhance your coding experience:

#### GitHub Copilot

- An AI-powered code assistant that suggests code and functions.

#### Turbo Console Log

- Automates the process of writing meaningful console log messages.

These extensions are optional as they can insert additional code that may be confusing for beginners, but they are excellent tools as you become more comfortable with the development process.

Feel free to reach out if you need help setting up or using any of these tools. Let's build something great with RealEstateRadar!
